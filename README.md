> Comments: Overall it looks very close to the design. Everything functions as it should. That being said, here are some things for your consideration. There is a little more letter spacing in the design than in your Advice #. You can adjust this using the tracking-[value] tailwind class. I also noticed you haven't replaced the title or used the favicon. Be sure to change those before submitting. Also I see you don't have a services folder. Remember its best practice to use a services folder for your fetches.
